Dans une démarche d’amélioration constante, nous prenons note de vos remarques et feedback sur notre process de recrutement. L'entretien téléphonique est une préqualification (pour optimiser le temps de chacun). Ensuite, lors de l'entretien en face à face, certaines questions peuvent parfois être reprises, car nous sommes très attachés à l’humain et les échanges permettent de comprendre le/la candidat(e) et d'identifier le fit avec les valeurs de l’entreprise et l’esprit d’équipe. Cette identification est également utile au candidat au moment de faire son choix. Concernant le test technique, il est habituellement apprécié des candidats puisqu'il permet de se projeter sur notre solution. A la lecture de votre retour, peut-être n'avons nous pas assez souligné cet objectif pour ce qui vous concerne. Nous prenons en compte votre remarque et veillerons à l'avenir à faire preuve plus encore de pédagogie. En revanche, nous ne pouvons accepter votre jugement quant au niveau de compétences de nos collaborateurs. Ces derniers exercent leurs rôles et possèdent le niveau de compétences idoine. Si leurs rôles sont différents de celui du candidat, leurs expertises sont donc différentes. Elles ne peuvent en aucun cas être présentées comme sous qualifiées. Dans une démarche de développement et d'amélioration continus, SimpliField est toujours à l'écoute des avis des candidats. Je vous invite donc, si vous le souhaitez, à me contacter par téléphone pour m'exposer et développer plus avant vos remarques.
